# Web Components the begining

## Info

This project is a beginning to start using Web components. It shows a way to create a couple of components that are connected between them, not only to generate a component but also to see how you can pass data from one to another. In the end we'll have four buttons that, when you click them, they'll show you some movie lines.

The project is deployed [here](https://iriscz.github.io/web_components_the_beginning/) And it's very close related with this [article](https://medium.com/p/7577e5cf2262) in which I explain the proccess developing it.
